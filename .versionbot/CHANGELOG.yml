                When we patch an ESR branch, for example from v2022.1.0 to
                v2022.1.1,

                do not update the next, current, sunset ESR  phases as they remain the

                same.

                Otherwise patch updates of ESR branches move the ESR phase when
                they

                should not. For example, if 2022.1.1 is current, 2022.1.2 is also

                current and should not move 2022.1.1 to sunset.
